# Service Worker and jsPDF Library Loading Improvements

## Problem Analysis
Based on the console errors you shared, there were timing issues with the jsPDF library loading:
- "jsPDF library loaded successfully" message appeared
- But "jsPDF library may not be loaded yet" warning also appeared
- This suggests a race condition or caching issue affecting library availability

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Service Worker (`service-worker.js`)
- **Version Updated**: Bumped to v2.6 to force cache refresh
- **Critical JS Handling**: Added special caching strategy for important libraries like jsPDF
- **Development Mode**: Improved to cache critical JS files even in development
- **Cache Warming**: Added pre-warming function for critical JavaScript files
- **Message Handling**: Added debugging capabilities to check cache status
- **Better Logging**: Enhanced console output for debugging

### 2. Library Loader System (`js/library-loader.js`)
- **Retry Mechanism**: Waits for libraries to load with configurable retries
- **Multiple Detection**: Checks various ways jsPDF might be available
- **Cache Integration**: Communicates with service worker to check cache status
- **Diagnostic Tools**: Provides comprehensive system information
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when libraries fail to load

### 3. Enhanced Image-to-PDF Tool
- **Async Initialization**: Changed to async pattern for better timing control
- **Library Verification**: Uses LibraryLoader to ensure jsPDF is ready
- **Multiple Fallbacks**: Custom implementation if main library fails
- **Better Error Messages**: Clear user feedback about library status
- **Debug Tools**: Added test buttons for diagnostic purposes

### 4. Caching Strategy Improvements
- **Cache-First for Critical JS**: jsPDF and other critical libraries use cache-first strategy
- **Background Updates**: Libraries update in background while serving cached versions
- **Force Refresh**: Ability to force refresh cached libraries
- **Better Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when cache fails

## New Features Added

### Debug/Test Buttons
1. **Test Toast**: Verifies toast notification system
2. **Library Check**: Runs diagnostic on all loaded libraries
3. **Test jsPDF**: Creates and downloads a test PDF to verify functionality

### Service Worker Communication
- Check if files are properly cached
- Force refresh specific cached files
- Get detailed cache status information

## Expected Results
- ✅ Faster, more reliable jsPDF loading
- ✅ Better offline functionality
- ✅ Clearer error messages and debugging info
- ✅ Reduced race conditions and timing issues
- ✅ Enhanced caching for better performance

## How to Test
1. Open the image-to-pdf tool
2. Use the "Library Check" button to verify jsPDF status
3. Use the "Test jsPDF" button to verify PDF creation works
4. Check browser console for improved logging
5. Try refreshing the page to test caching improvements

## Technical Details
- Service worker now pre-caches critical JS files during installation
- LibraryLoader provides 10-second timeout with 3 retry attempts
- Multiple detection methods ensure jsPDF is found regardless of how it's loaded
- Cache-first strategy for critical libraries reduces network dependency
- Enhanced error handling provides clear feedback about what went wrong
