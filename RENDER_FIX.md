# Render Deployment Fix

## Problem Identified
The deployment was failing because Render was detecting the root `package.json` file and trying to run it as a Node.js application instead of recognizing the Python backend configuration.

Error: `node index.html` - Render was trying to run Node.js instead of Python.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated render.yaml
- Added explicit `runtime: python-3.11` specification
- Ensured proper Python environment configuration

### 2. Created .renderignore
- Excludes root package.json and frontend files from deployment
- Ensures only the render-backend directory contents are deployed

### 3. Renamed package.json
- Moved `package.json` to `frontend-package.json` to prevent Node.js detection
- This file is only needed for local frontend development

### 4. Added test_backend.py
- Script to test backend functionality locally before deployment

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Render deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render:**
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Trigger a new deployment
   - The service should now use Python instead of Node.js

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Check that build logs show Python dependency installation
   - Test the health endpoint: `https://your-app.onrender.com/health`
   - Test the API docs: `https://your-app.onrender.com/docs`

## Expected Build Process
```
==> Building with pip
==> Installing dependencies from requirements.txt
==> Successfully installed fastapi uvicorn gunicorn...
==> Starting with: gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

## Frontend Configuration
For local development, rename `frontend-package.json` back to `package.json` if needed:
```bash
mv frontend-package.json package.json
```

## Test Backend Locally
Before deploying, you can test the backend:
```bash
cd render-backend
python test_backend.py
```

The deployment should now work correctly with Python/FastAPI instead of trying to run Node.js.
